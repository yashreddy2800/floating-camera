# Floating Camera

A lightweight macOS utility that shows a camera view as a floating, always-on-top overlay.

- Floating, borderless, resizable camera view
- Lock position with click-through passthrough to apps below
- Hover opacity when locked — dims on hover, restores on exit
- Size and position controls, with multi-screen support
- Customizable global shortcuts
- Persists settings across launches

## Quick Start

```bash
swift FloatingCamera.swift
```

## Build and Install

Place all files in the same folder:

```
FloatingCamera.swift
build.sh
Info.plist
FloatingCamera.entitlements
AppIcon.icns
```

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh   # first time only

# Apple Silicon (default)
./build.sh

# Intel Mac
./build.sh --intel

# Universal binary (runs natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel)
./build.sh --universal

# Build and install directly to /Applications
./build.sh --install
./build.sh --universal --install
```

The compiled app lands in `./build/FloatingCamera.app`.

**Requirements**

- macOS 12 (Monterey) or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

## Usage

After launching, an **aperture icon** appears in the menu bar. Click it to access:

| Menu item | Action |
|---|---|
| Camera submenu | Switch between available cameras |
| Camera Effects… | Open system video effects panel (Continuity Camera / external cameras only) |
| Show / Hide Control Panel | Toggle the Camera Controls window |
| Show / Hide Camera `⌃⌥H` | Toggle the camera overlay |
| Shortcuts… | Customise global keyboard shortcuts |
| Quit | Quit the app (`⌘Q` also works when the panel is focused) |

### Camera Controls panel

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| Lock | Freeze position; clicks pass through to windows below |
| Aspect | Lock aspect ratio |
| Reset | Reset aspect ratio to camera native |
| Center | Centre the overlay on screen |
| Mirror | Flip horizontally |
| Radius | Corner radius (0 = square, "Full" = circle) |
| Opacity | Window opacity |
| Locked hover opacity | Dims the overlay when hovered while locked |
| Size / Position | Exact pixel values; press Enter to apply |
| Move to… | Snap to any corner of any connected screen |
| Margins | Distance from each screen edge |

### Animation Controls

The **Camera Controls** panel now includes a full suite of animation settings, split into three logical groups:

- **Overall Animation** – selects the default animation preset used when showing or hiding the camera overlay.
- **In (Show) Animation** – controls the animation played when the overlay appears.
- **Out (Hide) Animation** – controls the animation played when the overlay disappears.

Each group provides:

| Control | Type | Range / Options | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Animation Style | `NSPopUpButton` | Spring Pop, Overshoot Bounce, Smooth Ease, Subtle Zoom, Slide In (Top), Slide In (Bottom), System Shake, Pulse Attention, None | Choose the visual effect for the corresponding animation stage. |
| Duration | `NSSlider` | 0.15 s – 1.00 s | Adjust how long the animation lasts. The range has been extended from 0.50 s to 1.00 s. |
| Bounciness *(optional)* | `NSSlider` | 0 – 20 | For spring‑based presets, controls the overshoot amount. |

> **Note:** The *Subtle Zoom* animation now correctly scales about the window’s exact centre, ensuring the circular preview does not drift left or right.

All settings are persisted via `UserDefaults`, so your preferred animation style and speed are restored on launch.


## Keyboard Shortcuts

Default shortcuts (customisable via **Shortcuts…** in the menu bar):

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Show / Hide Camera | `⌃⌥H` |
| Show / Hide Control Panel | *(not set)* |
